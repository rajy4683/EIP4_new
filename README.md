Convolution: 
  It is function where a matrix or a vector slides over another vector with corresponding elements multiplied and results summed up.

Filters/Kernels:
  An nxn matrix whose weights can act as feature selector when convolved over an image. In a specific layer there could be multiple kernels each having same size.

Epochs:
  The number of times a given model/algorithm iterates over the complete dataset passed to it.

1x1 Convolution:
  Convolution with filter-size 1x1. It re-maps the number of channels and can reduce the parameters by reducing the number of channels.   
  
3x3 Convolution:
  A convolution process with filter size of 3x3. It acts as feature extractor and can detect edges/gradients/patterns depending on the layer where it is used.
  
Feature Maps:
  The output generated by the process of convolution. The dimension of feature map depends on the size of original image and size of the kernel used.
  
Activation Function:
  Function applied element-wise on any matrix of real numbers. In CNNs, they are used to add non-linearity or create probability map.
  
Receptive Field:
  Portion of the image that a layer can see. With multiple convolution layers, the receptive field keeps increasing, thereby allowing to create complex features(E.g: patterns, parts etc)
